## üìù Explanation of Code

### HTML

- **index.html**: Contains the structure for the gallery and modals. Each image has a unique ID and is wrapped in a `<div>` for easier styling and manipulation.
- **Modal Structure**: Each image opens a modal on click. Inside the modal, we also have previous/next buttons to navigate between images.

### CSS

- **styles.css**: 
  - **Grid Layout** for displaying images in a 4-column setup on larger screens.
  - **Media Queries** ensure the gallery adjusts from 4 columns to 1 column depending on screen size.
  - **Animations** for smooth transitions when images are hovered or loaded.
  - **Responsive Design**: The layout changes based on the screen width to ensure the gallery looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

### JavaScript

- **script.js**: Handles the logic for opening the modal, closing the modal, and navigating between images using next and previous buttons.
